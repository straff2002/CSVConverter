                 INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS
                 ------------------------
>In this 'how to', it is assumed that the application is to be installed on an Ubuntu server, deployed through Apache and mod_wsgi
 however, the application is crossplatform and thus can run on virtually any OS/platform.
>Detailed instructions on how to install the three application(python, django, postgresql) are available on the 
 provided URLs.

1. Update and upgrade the system
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
2. Install python version 2.6 or 2.7 if not already installed (www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install django version == 1.8 (www.djangoproject.com/download/) 
    pip install Django==1.8
    
4. Download and install postgresql version >= 9.1 (http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/). Changed username to postgres to postgres2
   so as not to interfere with any future users/roles:

    ./configure
    gmake
    su
    gmake install
    adduser postgres2
    mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
    chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
    su - postgres
    /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
    /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &
    /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb skunkworks
    /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql skunkworks


5. Install 'psycopg2' for the database interface(This is how Django interacts with postgresql)
6. Install mod_wsgi (docs.djangoproject.com/ja/1.9/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/)

    Django settings, such as Time Zones, database host and port, Allowed hosts, etc are available on the 'csv_converter/sw/settinps.py' file
