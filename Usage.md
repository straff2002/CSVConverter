You bring these reports to Habari and choose the dropdown option for the application you want to use:

Here’s our Xero Contact import file


Yes that’s right, you can easily convert Xero Contacts

Upload your Xero contacts csv


Then click Submit Files


You’ll be taken to a screen which will provide you with the ability to change those fields that aren't acceptable according to your configuration file.

 
If the field length is too long, it will turn red, so edit it until the field turns blue.


Once all the fields are blue, click the Export button at the bottom and you’ll have a file that will import into Attaché through KFI!



Now doesn’t that seem easier than spending hours trying to migrate data manually?

The benefit of this application is that it allows us to create new migration configuration files whenever we come across an application that we’ve never met before. We’ve been using Xero for testing, but let us know what Applications you want. If you have done a migration before and kept the data, then we can quickly turn this into a new configuration file for you!

But don’t take our word for it, use the test Xero import file to try, let us know what you think!

If you want to test with a real Xero Contacts file, in Xero, go to Contacts, All Contacts
